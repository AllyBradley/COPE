# COPE DB User Manual

Welcome to the COPE DB Online Trials System. This guide provides an overview of what to expect as a user.

## WP4: Compare

The system is currently focussed on the WP4 trial.

### Overview
By visiting the system at https://cope.nds.ox.ac.uk/ you should see a page similar to the one below:

![Screenshot of the home page](static/screen_index.png)

A few key areas are:

* **The Navbar** - in blue, at the top of the screen. 
* **Page title** - largest text just under the Navbar]
* **Page trail** - Otherwise called Breadcrumbs, this should help you locate where in the system you are presently viewing
* **Footer** - At the bottom of the page, under a pale grey line are links to the supporting organisations and information about the current system version
* **Page Content** - is everything between the Footer and the Page Trail

The above image is of the Home page, when logged out. To access most sections of the system you will need a username and password (supplied by the COPE Admin team). 

> **Please ensure you keep your username and password details secure, and do not share them with anyone else**. All system actions are recorded and logged against the relevant user account for auditing purposes and you will be held to account for any actions taken with your user account.

### Logins and Passwords

Clicking on the Login button on the NavBar or any link that goes to a secure page will take you to the *Login page*, where you will be asked for your username and password. If you have forgotten your password, you an click on the `Lost Password?` link under the username text input, and you will be taken to a *Password Reset page*. Enter your registered email address (if you're not sure which one that is, please contact the COPE Admin team) to have a password reset link emailed to you. Once you have that email, clicking on the link will take you back to the website and prompt you to enter a new password twice.

Once you are logged into the system, the Navbar will update to something similar to the image below:

In the upper right corner of the page, on the Navbar you should now see some new links and menus. Working from the right hand edge to the left, we have:

* Logout - the "power on/off" icon is to securely log you out of the system. You should use this anytime you leave your computer or the website.
* Locale - the "globe" icon is to allow you to select your current location and will update the system to use terminology appropriate to your country
* User - the "person outline" icon is the User menu and shows some basic information about your account, and a link to Change Password
* WP4 Menu - The text "WP4: Compare" has a small menu linking to the various sections of the website, we'll cover more of this in a moment.
* Home - will take you back to the system home page from earlier (though still logged in).
