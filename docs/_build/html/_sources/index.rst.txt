Note on documentation
=====================

This documentation was assembled using Sphinx, with a combination of Markdown based files for the majority of the prose, intermingled with ReST for using Sphinx macros and autodoc extensions.

As ever, these documents are a work in progress. Most of this was written by Carl Marshall between 2015-2019, however as he has now left the project, please contact the COPE team (care of Prof. Rutger Ploeg) regarding further updates.
